<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Your Name</h3>

<p>This is one my favourite anime movies, the art style and everything about the movie is just really good.</p>

<h3>Bullet Train</h3>

<p>I enjoyed this movie a lot, there were so many small details that were not overlooked e.g the water bottle :), the japanese version of staying alive was fun to listen to.</p>

<h3>The Kingsmen (all of the movies)</h3>

<p>Honestly I could watch any of the movies directed by Matthew Vaughn just because all of his movies (that I have seen so far) have been really good, the action, the story and the playful acts that sometimes happen in his movie style is really the best.</p>
